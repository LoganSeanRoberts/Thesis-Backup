\chapter{$D \rightarrow \pi$ and $D_s \rightarrow K$ form factors: an improved determination of $V_{cd}$}\label{DstopiK}

My current idea for this chapter will be to include form factor findings for both $D\rightarrow\pi$ \textit{and} $D_s\rightarrow K$.  After all, the only difference between these two meson decays is the spectator quark.  They are calculated with the same dataset, and the quark transition/semileptonic meson decays are identical: a c-quark decays to a d-quark with the CKM matrix element $V_{cd}$. With that said, the eventual form factor plot of $D\rightarrow\pi$ will be different from $D_s\rightarrow K$.  A working section structure for this structure is as follows (it is possible I might change the chapter structure to group $D\rightarrow \pi$ an $B \rightarrow \pi$ together instead):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Introduction}.  Here I can give the context of CKM matrix elements and $V_{cd}$ specifically.  I plan to include a feynman diagram, a discussion of unitarity: $|V_{cd}|^2 + |V_{cs}|^2 + |V_{cb}|^2 = x$, and notes on leptonic and semileptonic determinations of $V_{cd}$.  
    \item \textbf{Correlator Fitting}.  This subject will likely be a truncated discussion of the topics found in chapter \ref{cha:fitting_correlation_functions}, put in the specific context of $D_{(s)} \rightarrow \pi(K)$.  This includes notes on simulation details, correlation functions, ensemble tables, prior choices, an fit stability plots.
    \item \textbf{Modified $z$ Expansion}.  Here I will present the $z$ expansion related functions again but in the context of $D_{(s)} \rightarrow \pi(K)$.  
    \item \textbf{Form Factor Results}.  Taking the work of the previous section I can then produce form factor plots for these meson decays.  
    \item \textbf{Determining $V_{cd}$} Finally we can then take the Form Factor results, combine them with experimental decay rates, and arrive at a calculation of $V_{cd}$. 
    \item \textbf{Discussion and Conclusion}. Finally a short section about summarizes the findings of the previous sections.
